# Sequel exercise

## Summary

Write a simple application in JavaScript or php that given a number of pennies will calculate
the minimum number of Sterling coins needed to make that amount.

Eg.123p = 1 x £1, 1 x 20p, 1 x 2p, 1 x 1p or £15.62 = 7 x £2, 1 x £1, 1 x 50p, 1 x 10p, 1 x 2p

## Requirements

- Account for only the common £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p coins. Ignore £
    coins.
- You MUST use JavaScript and/or php, CSS and HTML to do this. No server-side
    code is allowed.
- The user interface should consist of an input field that accepts an 'amount' string
    (Eg. 92p, £2.12) and displays the denominations needed when the user hits 'enter'.
- The application must work in the latest version of Chrome.
- All the files required to run the app should be added to Github (or equivalent).
- Please supply a url to your repo when you are finished.

## What we are looking for

- High quality and maintainable code.
- Logical whole commits with good commit messages
- Accessible, semantic, valid HTML.
- Well documented and commented code where necessary.
